**Memory MPC**

About

Memory MPC is a 2 player game designed to test your memory capability.  It was inspired by the DaftPunk sample app and has been redesigned using samples from the FatboySlim single "Renegade Master" and applied to an interface based on a sampler from the MPC series by the electrnoic musical engineering company, AKAI.

Controls

Play - Will begin the game, Player 1 always starts.
Reset - Will reload the page and reset all scores.
Next Player - Must be pressed after player 1 has finished in order to start player 2's round.
Sample Pads (to the left) - These must be pressed in order to trigger a sample.  Have a play around! 

Instructions

Once play has been pressed the computer will play back two samples which will light up purple on the pads.  After the sequence has been played, player must play back the exact same sequence in order to progress to the next round.  If the samples entered by the player are the same as the computers, an additional sample will be added to the computer sequence, which will then be played back to you.  This process will continue until player runs out of lives.  

  Lives - Each player has 3 lives.  If you sequence is not the same has the computers' you will lose a life.  
  Points - A point will be awarded for each successfull round e.g. if a sequence of 6 samples long is correctly played, i will receive 6 points.  There are no penalty points.


What I Learned

The most challenging part about making this game was understading how to successfully get the generated sequence to play which really forced me to better understand arrays and functions.  I also had to chop and change the tempo of the music track to get the samples to play in a coherent manner with eachother when the computer generated sequence was played which took longer than i had hoped. Overall the project further entrenched what we've been learning and i'm pleased with the outcome.
